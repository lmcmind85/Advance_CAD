##### Board Reflection
While I was pretty much told what to do at all times do to the instuctions that were very helpful, I did learn a couple new things that will probably be helpful in the future, one of those things was the split tool. The split tool allowed me to make a singular line cut and split the part in two. The other main thing that i was taught in this assignment was the move face tool. The move face tool is not very complicated at all and is really just a transfrom tool but shifting a face in a different direction, which is really nice to have.
#### Deck

Making the deck was super easy because it was just extruding a sketch of a rectangle and a cirle on each end to make a rounded edge. Using the split tool to seperate a part into differnet peices is a handy tool. 
#### Trucks

Making the trucks was quite simple if you just follow what the instructions tell you to do, when the trucks were changed it was also pretty easy to follow except for one part. The one time that I got stuck was when I changed something but something broke and it didn't break in the instuctions so I had to just figure it out myself.

#### Wheel and Bearing

This was not difficult. It gave me a refresher on dimensioning a sketch over a centerline to easily label the diameter of of a future revolve.
